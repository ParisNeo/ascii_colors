.. ascii_colors documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on [Date].
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ascii_colors's documentation!
========================================

.. mdinclude:: ../../README.md

.. note::
   The above README is included directly. Ensure `myst-parser` is installed (`pip install myst-parser`)
   and add `'myst_parser'` to the `extensions` list in `conf.py` if you want to render Markdown features
   within the README directly in Sphinx. Alternatively, manually convert relevant parts to reStructuredText.
   *For simplicity now, we will skip installing myst-parser and just include the text.*
