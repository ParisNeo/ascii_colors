Tired of bland terminal output? Need powerful logging without the boilerplate? **ASCIIColors** is your solution!

It combines beautiful, effortless **color printing** with a **flexible, modern logging system**. It features a comprehensive **compatibility layer mimicking Python's standard `logging` module** (just `import ascii_colors as logging`), making transitioning or integrating easier than ever. Plus, it includes handy **terminal utilities** like spinners and highlighting.

This documentation provides detailed usage instructions, examples, and the full API reference.

For a quick overview, installation instructions, and initial examples, you can also check the
